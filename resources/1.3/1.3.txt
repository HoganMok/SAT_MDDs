Remember to mention that it arrives in the goal location (1,5) at time step 5 but it moves back to location (1,4) at
time step 10 and head back to (1,5) at time step 10. Because it cannot be at the goal location at time step 10.
Set the earliest_goal_timestep to be 10 and added another check for goal codition in the if statement below.
if curr['loc'] == goal_loc and curr['time'] >= earliest_goal_timestep:
            return get_path(curr)
